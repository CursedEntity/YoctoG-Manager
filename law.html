                The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) has been facilitating computerization of over 1300+
                Road Transport Offices (RTOs) across the country. RTOs issue Registration Certificate (R.C.) & Driving
                License (D.L.) that are mandatory requirements and are valid across the country, subject to certain
                provisions and permissions.

                With wide variations in state policies and manual/ system based procedures being followed across the
                country, it had become necessary to define same standards for these documents on a pan-India level to
                ensure interoperability, correctness and timely availability of information. SCOSTA committee setup for
                this purpose had recommended a uniform standardized software across the country. The Ministry thus
                entrusted National Informatics Centre (N.I.C.) with the task of standardizing & deploying two softwares
                - VAHAN for Vehicle Registration and SARATHI for Driving Licenses and of compiling the data with respect
                to Vehicle Registration and Driving Licenses of all the states in State Register and National
