                <p id="actp1">NETC FASTag is a RFID passive tag used for making toll payments directly from the customers linked prepaid or savings/current account. It is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle and enables the customer to drive through toll plazas, without stopping for any toll payments.
                    <br><br>
                    The toll fare is directly deducted from the linked account of the customer. NETC FASTag is also vehicle specific and once it is affixed to a vehicle, it cannot be transferred to another vehicle. NETC FASTag can be purchased from any of the NETC Member Banks. If a NETC FASTag is linked to the prepaid account, then it needs to be recharged/ topped-up as per the usage of the customer. <br><br>If adequate balance is not maintained by the customer, the NETC FASTag gets blacklisted at the toll plaza. In such a scenario if the customer travels through a toll plaza without recharging then he won't be able to avail the NETC services and would be required to pay the toll fare through cash.

                <p id="optdes1">To request a FASTag, you can follow these general steps:
                    <br><br>
                    Research Issuing Banks: Identify the banks or financial institutions that offer FASTag services in your country. FASTag is widely used in India, for instance, and is provided by various banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India (SBI), etc. Visit the respective bank's website to proceed.
                    <br><br>
                    Online Application: Look for the FASTag section on the bank's website. Typically, there is an online application form available for FASTag registration. Fill in the required details, which may include your personal information, vehicle details, and relevant documents such as vehicle registration certificate (RC), identity proof, and address proof.
                    <br><br>
                    Document Submission: Upload scanned copies of the required documents, as specified by the bank. Commonly requested documents include your vehicle's RC, your ID proof (e.g., Aadhaar card, PAN card, passport), and address proof (e.g., Aadhaar card, utility bill, driving license). Make sure to provide accurate and valid information.
                    <br><br>
                    Payment: Pay the required fees to get your FASTag issued. The fees typically include the cost of the tag, security deposit, and initial wallet/top-up amount for toll payments. The payment can usually be made online through net banking, debit/credit card, or digital wallets.
                    <br><br>
                    Delivery: After successful completion of the application and payment, the bank will process your FASTag request. They will issue a unique tag identification number, link it to your vehicle, and dispatch the physical FASTag to your registered address through courier or postal service. This process may take a few days, depending on the bank and delivery location.
                    <br><br>
                    Activation and Recharge: Once you receive the physical FASTag, follow the provided instructions for affixing it to your vehicle's windshield as directed. Activate the FASTag by linking it to a supported bank account or digital wallet. You will also need to recharge the FASTag account with a sufficient balance for toll payments.
                    <br><br>
                    It's important to note that the exact process and requirements may vary depending on the issuing bank or financial institution. It's recommended to refer to the specific bank's website or contact their customer support for detailed instructions on how to request a FASTag.

                <p id="actp1">A car loan is a type of loan specifically designed to help individuals purchase a vehicle. It is a financial arrangement where a lender provides the borrower with funds to buy a car, and the borrower repays the loan amount plus interest over a specified period.
<br><br>
                    A car loan is typically needed in cases where individuals do not have enough savings to purchase a vehicle outright. It allows them to spread the cost of the vehicle over a longer period, making it more affordable. Car loans are commonly used by individuals who want to buy a new or used car for personal use but require financial assistance to make the purchase. The loan helps them acquire the vehicle and repay the borrowed amount in regular installments over time.</p><br>
