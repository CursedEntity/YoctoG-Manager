                The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) has been facilitating computerization of over 1300+
                Road Transport Offices (RTOs) across the country. RTOs issue Registration Certificate (R.C.) & Driving
                License (D.L.) that are mandatory requirements and are valid across the country, subject to certain
                provisions and permissions.

                With wide variations in state policies and manual/ system based procedures being followed across the
                country, it had become necessary to define same standards for these documents on a pan-India level to
                ensure interoperability, correctness and timely availability of information. SCOSTA committee setup for
                this purpose had recommended a uniform standardized software across the country. The Ministry thus
                entrusted National Informatics Centre (N.I.C.) with the task of standardizing & deploying two softwares
                - VAHAN for Vehicle Registration and SARATHI for Driving Licenses and of compiling the data with respect
                to Vehicle Registration and Driving Licenses of all the states in State Register and National
                Register.<br><br>

            <p>The applications VAHAN & SARATHI were conceptualized to capture the functionalities as mandated
                by Central Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 as well as State motor vehicle Rules.
                The latest initiative has been to centralize both these applications for ensuring higher tranparency,
                security and reliability of operations through a countrywide unified database and provision of a highly
                citizen and trade centric web enabled environment. The new application being developed would provide for
                a multi-user environment wherein the end customers may be empowered to perform most of the
                RTO related transactions (including payments) either from the comfort of home or from authorized third
                party service provider/s in their vicinity. This will also help, to a large extent, in removing the
                hassles and queues faced by citizens currently (in visiting RTOs for elementary types of
                transactions),minimizing the extensive paperwork currently being done on the ground and reducing the
                possibility of middlemen exploiting the uneducated / uninformed citizens. Going forward, mobile based
                applications would be developed and systems utilizing the Aadhar Based identification would also be
                integrated with the Unified RTO database<br><br>

They also provide a record of vehicle ownership, licensing, and maintenance history, which can be used for legal or regulatory purposes.

                <ul id="actp1">
                    <li>The licensing and registration of vehicles in India is governed by the Motor Vehicles Act, which mandates that all vehicles must be registered and licensed before they can be used on public roads. The process of obtaining a license and registration involves several steps, including providing proof of identity, age, and residence, as well as passing a driving test and vehicle inspection.</li>
                    <li>In India, the licensing and registration process is overseen by the Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) located in each state or union territory. These offices are responsible for issuing licenses, registering vehicles, and conducting periodic inspections to ensure vehicles meet safety and environmental standards.</li>

                    <li>To make the licensing and registration process more convenient and accessible, the Indian government has introduced several online services. These services allow applicants to apply for licenses and registrations online, schedule appointments for driving tests and vehicle inspections, and track the status of their application.</li></ul>
